## Editor Scripts


### FraxulPrefabUtils
A couple of utilities for batch-editing prefabs and batch reverting overridden properties of prefab instances.

### FraxulSceneVisibilityUtils
Uses the editor scene visibility manager to filter displayed objects by various useful criteria. I mostly use this for occlusion work and for optimizing worlds for GPU instancing.
